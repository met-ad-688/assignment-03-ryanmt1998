There is an upward trend in salaries with each additional year of experience, with most clustering around 50k to 200k. The higher salaries typically occur after 4 years of experience; in one case, a large number of people earned over 300k with 7 years of experience. On-site jobs offer a wide range of salary benefits that the other two job types can not match.\n"
